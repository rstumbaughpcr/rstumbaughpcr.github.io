Another interesting guest speaker that came to visit was BJ Levin, executive producer of Vice Media on HBO. Levin started off telling us about the values and goals of Vice and how they like to do business as well as showing us an episode of his show on HBO. <img src="img/events/vice.png" style="width:450px;float:left">
In this particular episode, Vice had a correspondent in West Africa talking to medical professionals and people who lived in the villages to follow up on the Ebola crisis and how things are have been in that area since the media stopped paying attention to the epidemic. What struck me was that instead of gathering news from other sources like the AP and Reuters, Vice sends their own correspondents to the areas and news stories they cover rather than just reporting “on” the news. In the other half of the episode, Vice had a reporter at a Columbia University protest against administration for turning a blind eye to sexual assault on campus. Sexual assault on college campuses has been an alarmingly large problem for a while now, and deans everywhere would rather sweep the incidents under a rug than make it into a big deal in order to save their reputation. Again, rather than have a talking head in a newsroom discussing these issues, Vice had a reporter in the middle of the action talking to students and administration getting the full story.

When the episode ended, Levin talked to us about the importance of internships and said that they are really the one key to getting a job. When we leave Maryland, we will leave with thousands of other kids with pieces of paper that say “You did it!” It is not the degree that will help us get a job but rather the connections we make and experiences we have while at university. Levin described the job hunt as climbing a mountain. In order to climb the mountain, there are three main things you need to do. First, learn the craft. I need to practice my programming skills, get software engineering internships, and become skilled in what I do in order to get a job as a programmer. Second, Levin says we should talk to someone who has already climbed the mountain. Networking and learning from people who are where I want to be in five or ten years is a great way to learn what I need to do and what it takes to succeed. Lastly, I need to get the gear and learn the tools I need to achieve success. In my case, the tools could be learning a specific programming language; however, in my opinion, it is more applicable to learn how to learn rather than learning a new language. The programming landscape is dynamic and changing and I need to be adaptive, for the most popular language now may be obsolete in ten year. The best analogy I have heard for it is that learning programming languages should be like riding a bike: while it may be strange to switch from riding a BMX bike to a mountain bike to a road bike, riding a bike is still riding a bike and I need to be able to smoothly transition from bike to bike throughout my career.

This was the second time I heard Levin give advice about how to hone my skills and make myself more marketable in the workplace, though his messages still ring true for me. It is imperative to get real-world experience, to have something that sets me apart from the rest of the massive amount of people with the same goals and aspirations as me. I've been looking since the beginning of the year for internships or job opportunities for the upcoming summer. Though most places aren't too interesed in freshmen, I will certianly keep looking and hope for the best!
