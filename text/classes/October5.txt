This class session was spent focusing on various innovative companies and what truly sets them apart. Innovation is not refined to any particular industry or specialty; the companies we discussed ranged from design firms to movie animation to online shopping. All of the businesses discussed, however, followed a specific framework that hints at the reason behind their successfulness: the 3P Framework. The 3P Framework revolves around the idea that the people, processes, and philosophies (the 3 Ps) are integral in a company’s ability to innovate. Here’s an outline of the 3P framework applied to a few of the companies we discussed...

IDEO was the first company we went over. IDEO is an innovative design consulting firm. Outside companies will go to IDEO when in need of a new design or idea for a new product or service. They are known for taking a human-centered approach to a problem and approach it from various different perspectives and viewpoints to get to the root of the problem. At IDEO, employees are multidisciplinary (MBAs, linguists, engineers, scientists, etc). People at IDEO are creative team leaders and possess the ability to think differently from the rest. David Kelley, CEO of IDEO, says he wants people who can say “no” to a boss; the boss can’t be right every time. The Deep Dive is IDEO’s main process when tackling a problem. It involves complete and total immersion in the topic at hand, tossing around any idea that comes to mind no matter how ridiculous it is. At IDEO, there’s no such thing as a bad idea. The main philosophy is “fail often in order to succeed sooner.”

In addition to IDEO, we also applied the 3 Ps to Apple, Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Pixar. All of these large, diverse, and innovative companies followed the same basic framework of stressing the importance of the people, processes, and philosophies that go into making a great and innovative product. 

While learning about this framework, I noticed that all of these successful companies were looking for the same type of open-minded, unique leaders to work for them. Though we only discussed a handful of businesses, it is a safe bet that every other company is looking for the same type of person to work for them. Throughout this course, I have learned a lot about myself; I have learned about my strengths, weaknesses, tendencies, and habits. I am usually a fairly reserved person when it comes to meeting new people and often am hesitant of going against the status quo. In order to think differently, I must not be afraid to challenge authority in order to speak my mind. This lesson was an interesting overview of what it takes to not only be a successful company but also what it takes to be able to work for an innovative company.
