Once we finally arrived, our first stop was the 9/11 Memorial. I wasn’t sure what to expect going into it; I had heard a bit about it and how moving it was, but really had no idea what I was getting myself into. When we first walked in, we were met with remains of the buildings, scorched fire trucks and ambulances, and pictures of the skyline before, during, and after the attacks. While it was all very emotional, I was really anticipating the company visits on the following day. We about 20 minutes walking around and listening to our tour guide describe everything in the room; the tour guide then stopped and told us about the next room we would be entering: the video gallery. She said that you could just spend hours in the video gallery, but unfortunately we only had about 45 minutes. “Yeah, right,” I thought. Once I got in there, however, I could immediately see what she meant.

The video gallery of the 9/11 Memorial was the single most moving and emotional place I have ever been. The gallery was full of eyewitness testimonies, first-hand news reports, and artifacts recovered at the scene. The first thing I noticed was the sheer sense of fear and panic in the voices of everyone involved: eyewitnesses, news anchors, firefighters, police officers, and family members alike. My mood had done a complete 180; I was somber, sullen, and serious. I allowed myself to get lost in the stories, to watch every live news report and listen to every 911 call. Nobody really knew what was going on at first. Some people who called 911 simply heard a loud boom and saw great billows of smoke pouring out of the North Tower. Others called and confirmed a plane crash and saw the airliner smash into the side of the tower. The most hard-hitting thing for me was the fact that nobody, <i>nobody</i>, knew what to do. News anchors had no idea what to ask the eyewitnesses who had called in to talk on-air. 911 dispatchers had no idea what to tell callers other than “get to safety.” For one morning, every person in New York City was struck with a sheer sense of terror and panic. What had moved me the most, however, was not the display of shoes, IDs, and clothes that were found at the site. It wasn’t the big charred fire truck sitting in the middle of the room. It was a little exhibit of only four or five pictures, tucked away in the corner with a “Graphic Content” warning. It was a collection of pictures of the people who had jumped from the burning building who wanted to go out on their own terms. The morbidness and humanity of it all sent chills down my spine. One picture in particular, titled “The Falling Man”, shows a man, upside-down, in free fall. The stillness of the picture combined with the gravity of the circumstances that drove him to jump still make me uneasy. 

I whipped out my phone and checked the time, and it was time to leave the museum and meet up with the group. As I rushed through the rest of the gallery, I realized I had only covered about half in the 45 minutes I spent in there; the tour guide was certainly correct in that I could’ve spent hours in there and not even realized it. I certainly plan to go back and walk through the rest of the exhibit.
