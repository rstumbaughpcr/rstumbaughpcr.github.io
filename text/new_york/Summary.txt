All in all, I had a great time all throughout the New York trip. I rode a roller coaster of emotions between the 9/11 memorials, the networking event, the hotel fiasco, and the company visits, but still loved every minute. I even reached out to BJ Levin and Brett Prescott about tech internships at VICE and talking to a software developer at Facebook! Levin just answered last night and put me in contact with the heads of IT at VICE, whom I emailed my resume and am now awaiting a response from. Brett forwarded my email to his friend in Engineering at FB and is just waiting for him to get back. This trip to New York taught me the true importance of getting involved and making myself stand out from the rest of the pack through internships and unique experiences.
