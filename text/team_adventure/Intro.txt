One weekend, our BSE class got split up into small teams and sent to Washington, DC. Before the adventure, we met up with Alan Gregerman, author of <i>The Necessity of Strangers</i>, who talked to us about the purpose of the trip and what we should learn along the way. For each of the five destinations we were supposed to visit, there was a summary, mission, and additional requirements. As we got off the bus in DC, we were dropped off at our first stop: the Portrait Gallery.
