Throughout this class, the importance of networking has been a resounding theme. Technical skills and experience will only get you far enough; networking and knowing people is arguably more important when it comes to landing a job. As I’ve admitted before in this reflection, networking and being bold has never been a strength of mine. After reading <i>The Start Up Of You</i>, I realized its true importance when it comes to furthering my professional and personal success. As a result, I have taken advantage of networking opportunities when they have presented themselves.

<strong>Networking</strong>
Though I’ve already talked about my networking experiences with BJ Levin and Brett Prescott, I feel I should discuss them again here. After visiting New York and hearing both Brett and BJ talk about the importance of networking, I was eager to get my name out there. A year ago, I never would have dreamed of doing something like this; I don’t even know these guys personally, and I highly doubt they remember me out of all the other students that came to New York. Nevertheless, I figured the worst they could say was “no.” I shot them both an email just asking if I could get in touch with someone on the engineering and programming sides of their company, and specifically asked Levin about any particular internship opportunities in the tech area. Brett got back to me pretty quickly and said he was going to email his friend in Engineering at Facebook and would let me know when he answered. I followed up a week later, but still have not gotten another response. I didn’t hear back from BJ Levin until I followed up with him around the same time, and he CC’d the heads of IT for VICE Media, who emailed me back and asked for my resume. Four days later, I’m still awaiting a response from them as well. Reading <i>The Start Up Of You</i> has inspired me to be more outgoing and bold in terms of networking.

<strong>ABZ Planning</strong>
A company hires me over other professionals because I am a dedicated, hard worker with a strong desire to learn and a passion for software development. I have spent countless hours over the past four years teaching myself programming and have not been paid a single dime for any of my work. If I am willing to pour that much effort into an endeavor on my own free will for no other incentive than to learn new concepts and skills, then it is clear that I will continue to stay dedicated and passionate about coding as well as learning new things as an employee. What I am offering is rare and valuable because as a freshman, there are not many other students with years of experience in programming. In the next four years, I will learn many more new concepts both in and out of the classroom; however, I have already taught myself many skills and strategies that computer science students may not learn until their first or second class. I believe my competitive advantage is my years of experience with Java and programming and my passion for learning new things.

Based on my competitive advantage, my Plan A is studying computer science at the University of Maryland while teaching myself mobile app development outside of school. Before I started this reflection, I had just began to teach myself iOS app development, which is developing apps for iPhones and iPads. Once I finish I certainly plan on continuing to teach myself mobile app development whenever I have time away from my classes and schoolwork. As the popularity of smartphones, specifically iPhones, rises, the need for competent mobile developers continues to rise as well. Mobile development skills are very desired in the computer science market; my friend, a sophomore CS student here at UMD, had an internship with a company in my hometown last summer working on mobile app development and said it was a great place to work and that mobile devs are definitely desired.

My plan B, however, would be to learn more about backend web development and be a web developer instead. I have experience with JavaScript, which is a very popular web programming language and a desired skill in the market at the moment as well. Front-end web development involves the design and actual interface of the webpage; back-end, however, involves the mechanics behind the front-end, such as what will happen when a button is clicked, etc. My Plan Z would be working at the tennis facility I worked at last summer. My old boss emphasized the fact that he’ll always have a spot for me on the staff schedule, so it’s good to know that I can fall back on that if necessary.

<strong>My LinkedIn Profile</strong>
A link to my LinkedIn profile can be found in the table of contents, but here are a couple of pictures of my profile...
