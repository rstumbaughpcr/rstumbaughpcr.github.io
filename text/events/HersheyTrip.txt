When someone says the word “innovator,” a certain type of person comes to mind. The tech giant. The entrepreneur. The Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerbergs, Sergey Brins of the world are often those that we consider to be innovators. Few, however, picture Milton S. Hershey. This man brought ideas never before heard of to the confectionery industry and the business world as a whole.

BSE took a trip to Hershey, PA to learn more about this fascinating man and the revolutionary concepts he introduced. Our first stop was at the Hershey Story museum, where we were able to walk through the life of Milton Hershey and follow the timeline of Hershey both as a company and a community. In 1900, Hershey started a caramel company but just three years later sold that company to make chocolates. Hershey realized that people enjoyed chocolate more than caramels, and adjusted his business to work with the market realities. What was truly unique about Milton Hershey was that he did not just want to start a chocolate company. He wanted to start a community. He made Hershey an entire town where people not only lived; they thrived. The town had a baseball team, a school, and a growing population. He utilized advertising and promotion as his primary weapons, where the Hershey brand promoted the Hershey town and vice versa. The entrepreneur encouraged residents to contribute to the town through growing livestock, opening grocery stores, even rival confectioners. Hershey wanted to do whatever he could to promote both his brand and his town. 

After visiting the Hershey Story, we traveled to the Hershey School to learn about its history. When the school was started in 1909, there were only four boys enrolled. The school was originally strictly for orphan boys, but now accepts applications from boys and girls of poverty or without many opportunities. At the Hershey School, students are taught practical skills to prepare them for the real world such as money management. Students leave the school much more confident and self-assured than they were upon enrollment. 

What strikes me the most about the Hershey School is how it is funded: the school is funded only from the Hershey Trust, which is now worth $12B. Three years after the death of his wife, Hershey gave up his entire fortune and put $60 million towards the school’s development. And nobody knew for five years that he had given up all of his money. This wasn’t some random act of charity for publicity or to improve his brand; this was a complete act of selflessness to ensure the prosperity of the children of Hershey, PA. I’m not sure any wealthy individual today would give up their entire fortune for a cause like this. 

Though Milton Hershey may not be the first name that comes to mind when thinking of innovation, he certainly made large impacts in both the personal and professional lives of many individuals.
