Reading about The Innovator’s DNA is one thing; in order to truly learn from it, it needs to be applied to your life in some way. The Innovator’s DNA is not a blueprint for innovative success but rather a way to train your mind to think like an innovator, which hopefully will result in innovative ideas. Each of the five skills can be applied in unique ways to everyday situations; it is all about training your mind to focus on these skills and apply them subconsciously. Since reading about these five skills, I’ve tried to incorporate them in my life. Unsurprisingly, it is a lot harder than I expected. As a result, I’ve found a few ways I can practice and hone my skills in the present and future.

<strong>Association</strong>
Of the five skills, association is the one I have gotten the most practice with. For a computer science major, my schedule is pretty multidisciplinary for this first semester: a course on media literacy, a course on innovation, a calculus class, and a programming class. Surprisingly enough, I’ve found a fair amount of overlap between these classes, especially between programming, media, and this class, BMGT289B. The premise of Media Lit has been to learn how to effectively read and interpret the media and its messages, which is all about reprogramming the mental codes and processes that we use to perceive media messages. Becoming proficient in the five skills of innovators is very similar to becoming media literate; we have to train our brain to the world around us and to approach problems differently and from new perspectives. In addition, we talked about the abstraction of ideas in Media Lit at the same time that we were discussing the abstraction of objects in programming. In Media Lit, an abstraction is a way to interpret an idea or concept; it’s like making a broad statement about an idea to better understand it. In Comp Sci, however, an abstraction of an object or class merely defines a set of general guidelines that all subclasses or sub-objects must follow. For example, if I have a class “Animal”, some methods I can abstract are “move”, “eat”, and “sleep”, because all subclasses of Animal will, undoubtedly, need to do these three things. Though my explanation of an abstraction in programming may not make much sense to a non-programmer, learning the two simultaneously in two different classes made it much easier to understand. Associating the skills I’ve learned in this class with the concepts learned in my other classes has been a very helpful way to learn new topics.

<strong>Questioning</strong>
My computer science class has also been the main place where I have been exercising my questioning skills. The class offers very unique and mentally challenging problems that sometimes need to be approached from very different perspectives. Often times when I’m stuck on a program or project, it’s because I can’t move past a certain detail or minute flaw in my logic. It’s at this point where I need to take a step back and ask myself, “What am I really trying to do here?” Most of the time, all I need is a simple refresher on what the goal of the project is in broad and simple terms and I can approach it from a new perspective. As suggested by <i>The Innovator’s DNA</i>, I plan on asking more questions to fully understand problems and situations rather than just giving answers and assuming I can’t learn anything. Now that I can vote in the upcoming 2016 election, I need to start asking more questions to fully understand all of the candidates and issues at hand.

<strong>Observing</strong>
Admittedly, observation is one of my weaknesses. While walking to classes or just walking around campus, I’m usually listening to music and in my own head, not really focusing on what’s going on around me. I tend to have pretty bad tunnel vision in general; whether it be walking to class or looking for something I’ve lost, I usually tend to focus just on the solution rather than the problem. <i>The Innovator’s DNA</i> suggests that I should observe more real people in real-life situations and see what they love and hate, what inconveniences they tend to experience and what usually goes pretty smoothly. Perhaps I’ll dedicate an afternoon or so to sitting and watching people and seeing how they interact with the world around them.

<strong>Experimenting</strong>
Experimentation is a very broad topic; it involves trying new things, meeting new people, listening to new ideas, exploring new cultures, and pretty much immersing myself in something new. Needless to say, college has been all about experimentation and trying new things. This is the first time I’ve been away from home for more than a week, and the first month or so was pretty weird for me. I’ve always had a close-knit group of friends, and coming to a huge school where I barely knew anyone was really tough for me. I’ve experimented with meeting new people, playing a club sport, greek life, and trying new food. Experimentation is necessary for growth, and I’m looking forward to all of the new things to try and experience!

<strong>Networking</strong>
As I’ve mentioned multiple times in this reflection already, I have gained some great experience with networking. I’ve talked to a recent computer science grad who now works at popular music streaming service Spotify as well as some employees at big corporations like VICE Media and Facebook. I’ve also talked to my friend, who is a sophomore computer science student, about internships in general and what I can do to set myself apart. He’s recommended learning mobile app development and said he’d put in a good word for me at the tech company he worked at the previous summer! Networking is a powerful skill and, as I’ve said before, can certainly not be understated in terms of importance. Often times, it’s not about <i>who</i> you know but rather <i>what</i> you know. I plan on broadening my horizons and not being afraid to meet new people and expand my personal and professional network.

Though I have made progress with the five skills of innovators, I certainly have a long way to go. I need to continue retraining my brain to think like an innovator and be more observant to the world around me. This book taught me a lot about what it takes to innovate and provided me with some valuable insights which I can ( and have ) incorporate into my everyday life!
