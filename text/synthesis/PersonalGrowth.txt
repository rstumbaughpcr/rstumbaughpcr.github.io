Throughout this entire course and my first semester of college, I have grown more than I ever would have thought possible. The biggest skill I’ve learned these past few weeks is time management and not procrastinating. All throughout high school, procrastination has been my biggest enemy; whether it be schoolwork or applications or anything else, I always used to put it off until the last minute. This class and especially this reflection taught me the importance of getting things started early.  A few of my friends are less than halfway done with their reflections as I’m writing this, with only two days left to complete the entire thing. To say college is harder than high school is an incredible understatement; the classes are much harder, and the work load is heavier than I ever would have expected. In college, procrastination is not an option. The main difference since high school that I have noticed is the constant feeling that there is always something else I should be doing. As a result, my time management and organizational skills have gotten much better. 

In addition to my management and organizational skills, I’ve improved in both confidence and social skills as well. Prior to college, I never really had to worry about meeting many new people as I had a tightly knit group of friends I had known since elementary and middle school. When I got here, however, I really had no choice but to make some new friends. Being in BSE has been a great way to make friends as we both live and go to class with the same people. I was a bit hesitant about being in a living-learning program at first, but I think it’s been a great decision. BSE has introduced me to some great people both as friends and in terms of networking. All of the networking events and professionals we’ve met have been an incredible resource and I’m very grateful for the opportunity!
