The Team Adventure challenge was an interesting and informative experience. I think anyone who is trying to learn about where innovation comes from and how to innovate can benefit from one of these exercises as they take the participants all over the city to a broad range of innovative companies. The main lesson I learned from this trip is that there is no “recipe” for innovation; innovative companies do not follow any specific mold for innovation. Innovation can come in any shape or size, and the Team Adventure showed me that it can truly come from anywhere.
