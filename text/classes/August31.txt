August 31: my first day of college classes. My first day of college was uncomfortable, nerve-wracking, and different, to say the least. After two lectures in Calculus and Computer Science, I walked to Tawes Fine Arts Building for my first BSE lecture. As I sat down, I looked around the room and saw a few familiar faces: some kids from my dorm, a couple from orientation, some more from the diner earlier. But I saw none of my close friends from home. None of the kids I had known for years, none of the kids that I had grown so accustomed to seeing on the first day of school for the last decade or so. It was new, it was different. It was terrifying, really.

Throughout the lecture, we overviewed the course and what we would be learning: the 3P Framework, the Innovator’s DNA, the Five Skills of Innovators. It was all gibberish to me, but I was excited. We were introduced to the word “innovation.” Of course, I had heard the word before, but it was hard to pinpoint its exact definition. As I have now come to find out, the concept of what it is to innovate and what it takes to be an innovator is much more complicated than I previously thought. Innovation is multi-faceted and multidimensional and much more difficult to achieve than I had thought.

In the lecture, we also discovered just how short the lifespan of dominating businesses has become. From 1920 to 1998 the tenure of a company on the S&P 500 had decreased from 65 years to just 10 years. I was looking forward to delving deep into how and why companies succeed and how they can stay innovative.

At the end of the first lecture, I left anticipating a semester of learning the keys and skills of innovators and being able to answer the question, “How do innovators think?”
