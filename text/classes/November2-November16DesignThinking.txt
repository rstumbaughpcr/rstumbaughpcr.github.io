For the past three classes, we have been doing a design thinking exercise rather than our usual lecture material. Though an interesting break from the norm, overall I was not impressed with the whole design thinking process. In the first class session, we did a “test drive” of design thinking in a shortened version of all of the steps as we tried to design a better way to brush teeth for our partner. At the end of this session, we were assigned the topic we would be innovating: trash. While the proper disposal of waste is certainly a problem we should be concerned about, I think the design thinking process would have gone over much better if we had been doing a topic that students cared about a bit. Though definitely important, separating trash and recycling isn’t something that excites students, and much less is something we would want to spend three class sessions on. I thought, however, that the process didn’t seem too bad during the “speed run” of design thinking, so it couldn’t be too bad.

For our first assignment, we had define a specific problem and interview our target audience. In my group’s project, our topic was the way Cambridge Community residents dispose of trash and food waste. We interviewed a resident in Cumberland Hall, a member of the SGA and RHA, and an RA for the floor and gathered their responses. In the next class, after spending 15 minutes going over the difference between saying, doing, thinking, and feeling, we were told to classify each response from the people we interviewed as something they say, think, feel, or do. At this point, we were getting frustrated; personally, the design thinking process was getting tough to take seriously when we had to spend so much time going over seemingly simple topics (such as the difference between say, think feel, and do) while we all had a very large PCR we had to work on. Nevertheless, I tried to keep a positive attitude about it all as we progressed through the process. We then had to craft a Point of View statement about our intended audience in an attempt to get inside their minds and place ourselves in their shoes, figure out what they <i>really</i> want. We figured out that the most prevalent reason for not disposing of food waste correctly was simple laziness; people just don’t really care enough about disposing of trash or food. After receiving some feedback from classmates on our statement, it was time for the final session: prototyping and demoing our product. 

In the final class, we had the facilitators review our revised POV statements and then we brainstormed different ideas as to how we could solve our users’ needs. During the brainstorm, no ideas were to be ruled out. Anything ridiculous, silly, unfeasible, or incredibly expensive was allowed to be posted, which resulted in some funny ideas like “eat other people’s thrown-away food to reduce the amount that goes to waste.” Eventually, we decided on feeding food waste to the goats on the farm next to the Cambridge Community. Goats will pretty much eat anything, and the less food that gets thrown away, the better. During our interviews, we found out that the smell of trash and food waste is also a problem, so we came up with an idea to reduce the smell of a trash can: the can will be contained in a big box with a shelf that you pull outwards, place your food and trash in, and then close up. Closing the shelf causes the trash to fall down into the interior garbage can. This way, the user never has to see or smell the trash directly, and everything gets properly disposed of. We had to create a prototype of our garbage can using the available tin foil, pipe cleaners, and construction paper. The purpose of making a prototype with such cheap materials was that it allowed inventors and designers to de-risk their products and create cheap physical model in the early stages of development. If a major design flaw was found, it would be cheap to re-start, both in terms of time and money. At the time, however, the prototyping felt like a glorified arts and crafts project. 

In all honesty, I’m not sure I can say I gained much from the design thinking process. Maybe it is just because I went into the class each day with a bad attitude; I felt that my time could be better spent working on this reflection rather than playing arts and crafts or sticking post-it notes to a chalkboard. The external assignments we had to do for design thinking further frustrated my group and I, because we didn’t have much free time as it was. I don’t mean to talk badly about the design thinking process or about the facilitators for our class. However, I personally don’t feel like I gained many applicable skills from the whole process. Nevertheless, I can see why it is a useful system and I’m sure it is very important and useful in the world of business and design.
