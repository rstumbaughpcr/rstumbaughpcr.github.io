Next, we left LinkedIn to visit VICE Media and talk to Executive Producer BJ Levin. Located in Brooklyn, the culture of VICE is much different than that of a typical New York professional work environment. The main floor of their office looked more like a hotel lobby than a workspace, but there were a few scattered employees on laptops working diligently. In the back of the area, there was even a bar with an open case of beer for the employees to drink. Needless to say, most of us were pretty interested in the culture of VICE from the moment we stepped inside. Levin took us out around back of the office where some employees were eating lunch on a picnic table on the outside patio. <img src="img/nyc/bjlevin_vice.jpg" style="float:right;height:400px;">
While out there, Levin detailed the real importance of networking and getting internship experience. He stressed the fact that when we leave Maryland, all we will have is a piece of paper. There will be thousands of classmates with that same piece of paper, and thousands more with better, more prestigious pieces of paper from more prestigious universities. In this respect, Levin said, we are at a disadvantage. Itâ€™s not the piece of paper that matters; it is what we do along the way that will determine how successful we can be. Internships, experience, and clubs and activities are integral in securing a job and setting ourselves apart from the other thousands of pieces of paper. 

We followed the producer back inside and down to the basement, which was filled with editing bays and rows of computers with dozens of employees. While down there, Levin stressed the importance of learning a new language, trying new things, experiencing different cultures. VICE covers news stories all across the globe, and everyone that works there speaks more than one language. One guy even said he speaks 17 languages! The trip to VICE taught me the importance of unique experiences and getting involved while here at UMD.
