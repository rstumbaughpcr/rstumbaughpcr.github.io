Founder of the Philadelphia Flyers, Ed Snider is certainly an authority when it comes to entrepreneurship. While detailing his personal (and political) beliefs, Snider shared with us his insights about not only entrepreneurship but about personal locus and how to be successful. He opened the discussion with the three values of the Why Enterprise foundation: be honest, don’t cut corners, and have integrity. Snider is a big believer in doing honest business and staying true to your values; in addition, he thinks that everyone should have fun doing whatever they may be doing. In the words of the entrepreneur, “For whatever reason, I have always been happy doing what I’m doing, whatever it was,” which resonated personally with me. For most of my life, I have had some type of job. Whether it be walking a neighbor’s dog after school or teaching tennis or in the kitchen of a nursing home, I have been employed since 6th grade. I learned quickly that hating something or having a bad attitude about it won’t make it any better. Dreading going to work or being miserable the whole time there will not make the end of my shift come any quicker, and it certainly won’t make it any more enjoyable. At all my jobs, I’ve tried to find some good aspect, some silver lining that will make me want to get up out of bed and go to work. <img src="img/events/snider.jpg" style="float:left;height:200px">
For instance, at ManorCare, a nursing home, I worked in the kitchen setting up trays and washing dishes. My friend and coworker would try and figure out the best and quickest way to get things done. Getting the muscle memory down made things go especially quicker and it allowed me to lose focus and let my mind wander, placing silverware on the left of the tray, desserts on the top left, meal ticket in the top center, salt, pepper, sugar on the top right, drinks on the lower right. While it wasn’t necessarily a fun task, sulking about it certainly didn’t make it go any quicker, so I tried my best to find the silver lining.

Looking for the best in things doesn’t have to stop in the workplace. I’ve learned recently that having a good attitude about things I have to do make them go a lot better than if I dread them. Though it may not necessarily be what you love, it doesn’t have to be something you hate.

Throughout his talk, Snider kept coming back to the point of doing what you love, especially in terms of a career: “money should be the reward, not the reason.” For the past four years, I’ve been learning programming because it’s something I love to do and something I’m good at. I’ve spent hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hours working on independent projects just for fun and because it’s what I really enjoy doing. I haven’t made a single penny off any programming project I’ve done, and that’s okay! When I finally do start working in the industry, money will certainly be the reward instead of the reason.

Above all else, Ed Snider believes in a strong respect for entrepreneurs and enterprises as well as an intrinsic sense of motivation for the sake of being motivated. Whatever it is you end up doing in life, Ed Snider and I share the belief that you should try to make the best of it and be happy.
