After leaving the portrait gallery, we headed to another one of our stops: Tesla Motors. Tesla’s showroom had a Model S, their only car currently sold to the general public, and a chassis showing off the electric motors used to power the car. The Model S, with a base price of around $100,000, is a fairly popular car, given the price. It runs solely on electricity instead of gasoline or any other fuel source. To learn more about the car, we talked to one of the employees that was working to get a better idea about the electric car’s capabilities. According to her, the best time to charge the car is overnight, as it gets 3-5 miles per hour of charging. Surprisingly enough, the cost of electricity for the car is still considerably less than paying for gasoline for the same amount of driving time. Tesla also has scattered Supercharger stations which will give the car enough juice to run for 300 miles in only an hour! As I sat inside the car, I noticed that the entire middle console and dash was a touch screen. In essence, the car is one big computer. Curious about the security of the computer, I asked the employee how secure the car was against cyber attacks; if someone gains access to the computer, they have access to the entire car’s functionality. She told me, however, that Tesla pays people to try and hack into the car and the only way someone has successfully gotten inside the system was through a wired connection directly to the computer. When I got back from the trip, however, a quick Google search told me that back in August, hackers successfully got inside the car. Tesla quickly released a patch and all (known) security issues have been resolved. 

What makes Tesla innovative is not just their electric cars, however. Each car is made-to-order, and customers order directly from the manufacturer as opposed to buying a car from a dealership. This option is cheaper for Tesla and better for the consumer. Though it could a couple of months to get the car from the time of order, customers don’t have to deal with a middle-man when buying a car. As shown by the recent hike in popularity of Uber and related services like Airbnb, giving people the power as both employees and customers is a popular and effective move.
