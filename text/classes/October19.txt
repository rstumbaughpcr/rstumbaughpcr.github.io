This class, we discussed creativity, confidence, and disruptive innovation. Clayton Christensen explores the concept of disruptive innovation in his book The Innovator’s Dilemma. The dilemma of the innovator is if he or she has an innovative idea and goes to higher management, they are likely to shoot the idea down if it disrupts their current product and puts their cash cow at risk. <img src="img/classes/disruptive.jpg" style="height:200px;float:left">
According to Christensen, a “disruptive innovation” is any innovation which begins its life cycle at a lower pricepoint and lower quality than the product which it is disrupting. This innovation appeals to a brand new or niche market that is being underserved or overlooked. Over time, however, the incumbent product overshoots customer needs and eventually flops. The new entrant, however, becomes more successful and eventually meets customer needs and overtakes the incumbent. These are the four elements of a disruptive innovation: sustaining innovations by the incumbent, overshooting customer needs, new entrant enters the market, and, finally, the incumbents are disrupted and flounder. Of the 77 companies analyzed by Christensen in his research, however, only 9% met all four requirements. While case studies and stories on disruptive innovation are great to have an idea of how to innovate and what to look out for, they are certainly “no substitute for critical thinking.” Though only seven companies met all four requirements, all 77 were disruptive innovations. This goes to show that Christensen’s four elements are not instructions but rather guidelines or predictions as to how disruptive innovation works.

In order to even come up with an innovative idea, one must have confidence in his or her creative abilities. Professor emeritus at Stanford Albert Bandura believes in “guided mastery” to overcome personal fears. This involves immersing yourself in your fears in order to overcome them. With guided mastery, an innovator can turn fears and weaknesses into strengths and become the master of their weaknesses. Perhaps even more important than the idea of guided mastery is that of self-efficacy: the idea that you can change yourself and the world. A sense of self-efficacy is necessary to become a master of creativity and innovation.

Personally, the concept of self-efficacy was very eye-opening. Throughout the college application and admissions process, it seemed like I was constantly being reminded through being denied from universities and watching my friends be accepted to Ivy League schools that I was not good enough. Whether it be not good enough for Penn or Princeton or some scholarship or some special program, I felt like I wasn’t good enough. Now, in a school of 30,000 students, it seems nearly impossible to make myself stand out amongst the crowd. After reading about self-efficacy, I came to the realization that I am in control of my own life, my own goals, my own future. I am the only one who can decide what I want to do. While I may not be the best of the best, I’m the best I can be, and I have the power to change my world.
