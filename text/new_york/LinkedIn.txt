The following morning, we started off the day visiting LinkedIn, whose office was in the Empire State Building. We were all dressed in business casual attire, but the employees at LinkedIn seemed much more casual and relaxed. We first heard a presentation about a relatively new feature on LinkedIn: Publishing. Users can publish things to their profile which can be seen by all of their connections. Posts that users publish can be about anything they want; whether they are sharing their insight or points of view on a topic or posting a link to an interesting article, Publishing adds another dimension to a LinkedIn profile and lets people see what you’re really like past your resume and experiences. It adds a more personal touch to a profile. Afterwards, another employee spoke to us about the importance of networking.

As suggested by the Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha, authors of The Start-Up of You, building a personal and professional network is an important key to success. The theme of networking seems to keep popping up, and I now realize just how truly important networking is. Skills won’t get me all the way; I need to leverage my skills and get to know people in high places in order to truly get the jobs that I want.
