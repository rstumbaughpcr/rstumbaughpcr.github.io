Steve Jobs: the poster child for innovation. It’s no secret that Apple Computers has changed the world; you’d be hard pressed to find a teen who doesn’t have an iPhone or MacBook at home. The question is, though, what made Jobs so successful? He was certainly a unique individual. From fruitarian diets to walking barefoot to not showering for weeks at a time, Jobs certainly had some strange habits. Regardless of how strange he was, however, Jobs left us with many important lessons. 

Clearly, Steve Jobs embodies the Innovator’s DNA perfectly. His associational thinking skills allowed him to see connections between things that nobody else could see, such as the importance of typography in a computer. His ability to network enabled him to meet people like Al Alcorn and Nolan Bushnell at Atari and use them to expand his personal and professional network. He was constantly experimenting with new ideas for the design of his computers, like using a plastic casing for the Apple II to make it more visually appealing and approachable. Of course, his questioning never ceased as well: Why do we need a fan in a computer? Why is that company so successful? How can we make our products more appealing to consumers? Lastly, his observational skills were certainly helpful to during his rise to success. He was very perceptive to the world around him and how the Western mind works after his trip to India. Jobs was very strong in all of the five skills of innovators; then again, so are many other CEOs and innovators like Jeff Bezos and David Kelley. So what sets Jobs apart from the rest? To answer this question, I think we should start by taking a look at Jobs’ personality.

Steve Jobs was a very polarizing person, to say the least. He was unforgiving, crude, arrogant, and self-centered. There’s the infamous story of his first gig at Atari, where he allegedly paid Steve Wozniak significantly less than half of the money received. He also refused to believe that his on-again, off-again girlfriend Chrisann Brennan’s daughter was his, even after the paternity test results indicated a 94% match. He left most of his friends in the dust to further his own goals and didn’t see them as anything more than a way to leverage success. He would fire anyone who didn’t share his visions, and was incredibly picky about who he hired in the first place. Objectively, Steve Jobs was a Grade-A asshole. 

His stubbornness combined with his genius resulted in something brilliant, however. Jobs had incredible insights as to how to market a product and the importance of design. When selecting employees for the Macintosh project, he would dramatically reveal the computer from under a cloth and closely examined their first reactions; if they were not visibly excited and astounded, they would not get the job. Jobs wanted people who shared his enthusiasm and passion for what they do. He had incredibly creativity and insights and would not settle for anything less than perfection. Things always had to be done his way, and if anyone told him it was impossible, they were fired on the spot; Jobs had no tolerance for people who stood between him and his vision of perfection. He believed that the customer didn’t really know what they wanted and lived by the famous Henry Ford quote: “If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse.” 

Steve Jobs was simply an incredible person to be around. I found a first-person testimony of what it was like to “take a walk” with Steve Jobs from his friend of 24 years, Michael Murdock. Murdock said that walking with Jobs was like an escape from reality: “once you started walking with Steve time sort of froze and the two of you seem to be transported to another dimension where time didn't matter and all.” Murdock’s response, which can be found <a href=”https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-take-a-walk-with-Steve-Jobs-If-you-were-invited-were-you-excited-or-apprehensive” target=”_blank”>here</a>, was that walking with Jobs was “simply magical.” 

<strong>Does Jobs deserve to the the patron saint of entrepreneurs or is he merely a devil in disguise?</strong>

I personally think that the life of Jobs was neither the “patron saint of entrepreneurs” nor a “devil in disguise.” I think he was the exception and not the rule, so to speak. The only reason he could get away with being such a stubborn, hard-headed asshole who wouldn’t let anyone tell him that his ideas couldn’t be done is because of his genius and never-before-seen ability to create new and successful ideas. Steve Jobs had incredible insight and was able to get inside the mind of the consumer unlike anyone else, and that is why his ideas were so successful. He knew that the design of a product was just as important as its function, so he made sure that his products were as simple as they were sophisticated. He knew that his software had to be intuitive and easy to use for tech outsiders, so he wouldn’t let anyone tell him that his ideas were ridiculous and couldn’t be done. I think that Steve Jobs, though not a great person, was a fantastic entrepreneur and businessman; however, he was an incredibly unique person and most people should not strive to emulate him.

<strong>Jobs held closely to Mike Markkula’s edict that a good company must “impute”—that everything from packaging to marketing must convey a product’s value and concept. How does Apple accomplish this? Can you think of any other products that you consume or interact with that also “impute”?</strong>

“Impute” is an idea that originally came from one of Apple’s first investors, Mike Markkula. It means that an product, in order to be successful and desirable, must <i>impute</i> success and desirability. The Apple II launch at the West Coast Computer Faire was the first notable example of Apple imputing success onto its customers. Jobs made sure the booth that showcased the computer looked sleek and professional and stacked empty Apple II boxes in the back of the booth to make it look like the small company already had dozens of computers on hand despite the fact that the three computers they had on display were the only three they had created. In modern times, Apple imputes the idea of sophisticated simplicity through every aspect of their design and appearance. Apple’s Logo is simply a black apple with a round bite taken out of it. The iPhone has only one button on the face and three on the sides for volume and locking the screen. The Apple Stores are nothing but tables with a few devices on display to test drive. My favorite example of Apple’s sophisticated simplicity is the entrance to their store in New York City, which I had the privilege of seeing on our trip to New York. The entrance of the store features a big bright Apple logo surrounded by glass, which seems pretty bland on the surface. However, the logo reflects off the glass and makes a cool array of Apple logos on all of the reflections. A seemingly simple display turns into a beautiful design in thin air. To this day, Apple still manages to impute its sophisticated simplicity beautifully.
