The importance of networking has been a recurring theme from every guest speaker; from media executives to Facebook employees to investment bankers, everyone recognizes just how important networking is. There is, however, a difference between meeting lots of people and networking. The latter involves meeting people who you can learn from and can help forward your personal and professional success, and, in return, you can forward theirs. Networking requires not only meeting new and interesting people but, more importantly, knowing the type of people to look for. In The Necessity of Strangers, Alan Gregerman outlines the importance of having an open mind and searching for a broad and diverse set of perspectives when it comes to meeting people. Personally, I get very reserved and quiet when around new people; I am not normally one to be bold and take risks upon meeting strangers. As a result, I’ve made it a point to be more outgoing and extroverted when meeting new people and care less about what they think. Instead of being preoccupied with what they are thinking and how silly I may look, I’ve been trying to just be myself when meeting new people.

The importance of networking certainly cannot be understated, so I’ve used a couple of connections made in the BSE program to meet new people and perhaps open some doors for myself. Last week, I emailed Brett Prescott from Facebook and BJ Levin from VICE Media to ask general questions about working in technology and programming and to ask if there are any available internship opportunities for a freshman like myself. Brett got back very quickly and forwarded the email to his friend in Engineering, from whom he is awaiting a response. I followed up with BJ after a week, and he responded almost immediately saying he would pass me along to the heads of IT at VICE. The IT people then asked for my resume, and now I’m waiting for a response from them! It’s incredible to see how just a few quick emails to some people I don’t personally know can have such great potential to reveal new opportunities. Connections are a great way to open new doors; in my experience, people like being nice. I enjoy being nice to others, and kindness is usually met with kindness. I would want to help out people in my personal and professional network, and I would hope they feel the same.

<h3>Team Adventure</h3>
Though I’ve lived within an hour of Philadelphia for my entire life, I don’t venture into the city very often. I’ve been in the city a fair amount of times, but I haven’t been there nearly as much as some of my friends. Nevertheless, Philly is an incredible and unique city with lots to offer and certainly lots to learn. An exercise like the one we did in Washington, DC would certainly yield interesting results, and I’m curious as to the first impressions Philly would give people who had never been there before. For any team adventure exercise in Philly, there are definitely some essentials…

<strong>Go to a concert</strong>
A trip to Philly isn’t complete without going to a concert! Most of my trips to Philly have been for a concerts. From free shows in the Piazza at Schmidts to alternative concerts in the Electric Factory, some of my best concert experiences have been in Philadelphia. Music is a huge influence on my life, and I think people should experiment with listening to all different types of music. While at the concert, a few things participants should think about / do:
<ul>
        <li>If possible, see a band or genre of music you’ve never heard of. Because Philly has such a big music culture, there are underground or indie bands playing all over all the time.</li>
        <li>Take note of the kind of people that show up. What is the main demographic for this band / artist?</li>
        <li>Ask someone else there how they got into listening to the band or why they like them</li>
        <li>Ask an employee about their best experience working at the venue.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Visit the Franklin Institute</strong>
The Franklin Institute is an awesome place to learn about the history of science and innovation. There are always unique exhibits to check out as well as the classics that are there year-round (especially the Giant Heart). From a planetarium to an exhibit on the human body to a real steam locomotive, there really is something for everyone at the Franklin Institute.
<ul>
        <li>Ask a complete stranger for directions. Maybe strike up a conversation and ask about their favorite exhibit.</li>
        <li>Visit an exhibit about something you’ve never learned about before. The Institute is a great resource for knowledge and most of their explanations are very understandable and interesting.</li>
        <li>Watch a movie in the IMAX theater! I’ve seen a few movies in the theater and it’s certainly an awesome experience for those who have never tried.</li>
</ul>
<strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong>
Even though you might not be a student, UPenn is an incredibly unique place to visit and just walk around. A city school with a campus feel to it, UPenn has both old gothic architecture and contemporary buildings alike. They hold founder Benjamin Franklin in high esteem, and his influence on the school is clear.
<ul>
        <li>Find out why Ben Franklin is so important to the school. Take a seat with Ben on the Bench, ask a staff member, and just walk around the campus!</li>
        <li>Take a walk down Locust Ave and look at the wide variety of buildings for clubs and organizations on the brick avenue. Penn prides itself on being an interdisciplinary school</li>
</ul>
<strong>Philadelphia Museum of Art</strong>
The Museum of Art is certainly a place to check out on any trip to Philly. One of the largest art museums in the country, the building holds over 227,000 pieces of art. Needless to say, the art museum can definitely keep you busy for a while.
<ul>
        <li>Visit an exhibit from a time period in history or place you have never heard of. Ask one of the staff about the artist(s) and what makes these paintings unique.</li>
        <li>Ask a stranger what their favorite exhibit is. After all, the activity as all about connecting with strangers!</li>
        <li>Learn something new about a topic you are fairly familiar with. Nobody can know everything about a topic, so there’s bound to be something you don’t know.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Uber</strong>
Though you were probably already planning on it, the last challenge is to take an Uber around the city! Uber is a great way to get convenient transportation and meet interesting people. Of the three times I’ve taken an Uber, all of my drivers have been from foreign countries. There is certainly something to be learned!.
<ul>
        <li>Learn about your driver. Talk to him or her and, if they are comfortable talking about it, ask them where they’re from, why they came here, and about their experience being an Uber driver. Uber drivers are incredibly interesting and unique people!</li>
</ul>
