In today’s meeting, we spent about half the class discussing Steve Jobs and how he embodies the skills of innovators. One of his most important and pervasive ideologies is that of design thinking. Jobs believed that the design of a product was integral to getting people to like it. Unlike conventional CEOs, Jobs didn’t worry about money, accounting, and market share. Instead, he focused his energy on creating great and attractive products, building up the Apple brand, and hiring a fantastic staff. Nokia, in contrast, was determined on having the majority of the market share of mobile devices. They dominated the world’s market share but were not necessarily concerned with the quality of their products. Apple, however, was not concerned about the market share but rather building a great product. 

Jobs’ belief in Zen was also a huge impact on his outlook on life and a great example of his observational skills. While traveling abroad in India, he observed how cluttered the Western mind is and how busy people in Western culture always seem. Jobs noticed that if he trained himself to be able to calm his mind down, he was able to view problems with a more open mind and could approach conflicts from a different perspective. The concept of Zen was a great influence in Jobs throughout his career.

In addition to observation, Steve Jobs had a proclivity for experimenting with new or strange ideas. Jobs would often create many prototypes with very small differences in design that were almost imperceptible to others and experiment with the various mockups. His obsession with design and perfection allowed him to get inside of the mind of the consumer and try and figure out what they really want, even if they don’t know they want it yet. One of the earliest known examples of Jobs’ ability to experiment is the Blue Box, a device he invented with Steve Wozniak to bypass AT&T’s long distance calling fees. Steve Jobs’ unfettered curiosity and experimentation made him a model innovator.

In my personal experience with programming, web design, and being an end user of many different types of software and smartphones, Jobs’ obsession with design was certainly justified. Some of my personal programming projects are more visually appealing than others, and the projects that look better are generally received more positively than those with unappealing graphics, regardless of their technical complexity. Jobs focused on building the aesthetic of simplicity, efficiency, and fluidity within his brand and his software. The look and feel of iOS, iPhone’s operating software, is very modern and creates an environment of productivity and efficiency. For a product to be successful, it must not only work well but also be visually appealing to users.

Jobs’ insights on Zen and how to truly calm the human mind are also lessons I plan on integrating into my personal life. As a college student, I can attest to the fact that stress, if managed incorrectly, can dominate your life. Stress and anxiety result in many bad habits and I feel like I constantly need to battle against stress and laziness in order to stay up to date with work. Since reading the Jobs biography, I have been trying to remind myself to stay calm and not let stress get the better of me.
