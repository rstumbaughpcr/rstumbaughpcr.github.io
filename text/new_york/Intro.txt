Towards the end of October, I was lucky enough to have the amazing opportunity of travelling to New York and meet employees of huge four huge companies: LinkedIn, VICE Media, Facebook, and Goldman Sachs. I got more out of this trip than I ever thought I would, and I’m so glad I got the opportunity to go to NYC with my classmates. We all met bright and early in front of Centreville Hall, suitcases in hand and still half-asleep. The long bus ride didn’t seem so bad; I had brought my laptop to get work done on the way there but realistically just used it to watch movies on the way there. The bus ride seemed quick, and I was eager to start our day in the big city.
