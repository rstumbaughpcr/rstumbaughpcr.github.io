After Tesla, we walked around DC to both Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s. Both grocery stores focus on organic, healthy food and are wildly popular. While at both stores, we asked some customers why they shop there and what makes one better than the other. At Whole Foods, the woman we asked said she shops there because she can trust that no harmful products will be put into her food and that everything she buys is organic and healthy. Trader Joe’s customers, however, prefer TJ’s because of its low cost and relative healthiness. While walking from store to store, we found a couple carrying bags from both Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s and asked them what they liked about each one. They said they prefer TJ’s because it’s generally cheaper but will go to Whole Foods for premium products like meats. Trust and transparency seem to be the overarching theme shared by the two stores. While GMO’s (Genetically Modified Organisms) are not nearly as harmful as they have been hyped up to be, customers shop at these stores to ensure they are getting organic, natural, and healthy foods.
