Alan Gregerman, author of <i>The Necessity of Strangers</i>, came back today to talk to us about the true necessity of strangers and just how much we can learn from them. As stated in his book, a wide and diverse group of strangers can be more beneficial than a personal and professional network of people who are just like is. During this session, we recapped our trip to DC and he asked what we thought about all of the destinations. It was interesting to hear all of the different responses and experiences the groups had even though we travelled to the same places for the most part. I really enjoyed the Team Adventure exercise; we got to walk around DC on a beautiful day and visit companies and stores I had never been to, like Tesla and Trader Joe’s. 

After going over the Team Adventure, Gregerman recited some case studies from his book about times that relying on strangers and the unknown proved to be more useful than consulting those who are like us. The example that stood out to me the most both from the book and from Gregerman’s presentation is that of the two rivaling explorers who embarked on a race to the South Pole. <img src="img/events/gregerman.jpg" style="float:right;height:300px">
Norwegian explorer Roald Admundsen relied on the advice of strangers who were familiar with the terrain and incredibly cold conditions. He asked a tribe of Inuits, who were certainly no strangers to cold weather, how to survive and thrive in incredibly cold climates. They taught him important skills and said that the best animals to bring with him would be dogs. Admundsen then assembled a small team of 19, heeding the advice of the Inuits yet again, and headed to the South Pole on a race against English explorer Robert Falcon Scott. Much unlike Admundsen, Scott did not consult the Inuits or anyone who had experience living in cold climates. Instead, he asked scholars and scientists in England, for they were <i>obviously</i> the best resources to consult as they were supposedly some of the smartest men in the world. Scott also assumed that since horses performed so well on dry land, they would clearly be the best animals to bring along with him to the South Pole. Unfortunately, the horses died very quickly of the intense cold. Scott also decided it was a great idea to take 65 explorers with him, because the more the merrier, right? Wrong. When Scott finally reached the South Pole, he arrived five weeks after Admundsen had. Scott and his four remaining men died on the return journey. Admundsen, on the other hand, made it back with no loss of lives. This story is a great case study of the effectiveness of trusting the right strangers. 

From Gregersen’s talk, I learned that many times, strangers hold the answers that we need. We so often surround ourselves with people that are like us, that come from similar areas and have had similar experiences and work in similar industries. This, however, is detrimental to the diversity in perspectives and backgrounds of our personal and professional networks. I plan on being more open to strangers and am humbled by the fact that everyone everywhere knows something that I don’t.
