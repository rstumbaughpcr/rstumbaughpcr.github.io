On our last stop, we went to Georgetown for lunch and to visit the Apple Store. I called us an Uber to take after we left Trader Joe’s, and the car was there within minutes. Our driver was not very talkative but was certainly polite and courteous. Driving in DC seems like a huge headache, and our driver didn’t fail to entertain while driving aggressively, honking at everyone, and being visibly frustrated at other drivers along the way. We got lunch at Chipotle, which is an insanely popular restaurant that uses an assembly line type of food prep that make the process go swiftly while letting the user pick everything they want in their burrito. After lunch, we visited the Apple Store in Georgetown. I personally love everything about Apple Stores. They are always packed with people; the first time I had been to one, I was incredibly underwhelmed. The stores feature tables with numerous products on display for users to try out and play with, but nothing particularly fancy. They truly live up to Apple’s design mantra: “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” We left Georgetown and took the Metro all the way back to College Park, meeting up with some other classmates along the way.
