After VICE, we visited Brett Prescott at Facebook. As soon as I walked in the door, I knew it was a place I wanted to work. The walls were covered in motivational posters and strange cloud-like shapes hung from the ceilings. As we walked back to the conference room, we passed a couple of guys with Lego Star Wars sets all around their workspace and the original trilogy laserdiscs playing in the background. Again, we were pretty overdressed; everyone was wearing jeans and a t-shirt, while we are all in dress shirts, slacks, and ties. As we walked through the office, Brett told us all to grab a snack and a drink from the snack area (which is free for all employees).

Throughout the presentation, he told us about Facebook’s initiatives and his personal story of how he ended up working at Facebook. Interestingly enough, he was part of the original team that came up with the name for iHeartRadio, a popular internet radio service. Brett, who is part of the Advertising team, discussed the thought process behind Facebook’s advertisements and how the social media network allows them to create personalized ads versus general ads for a broad market. Specifically, he discussed the Madden 15 ad campaign, which involved tailoring the ads for each individual user based on which teams they have “liked” on FB. Because they appear in the users’ news feeds rather than on national television, they are able to quickly produce new ads and change them to suit each user better. As a result, Madden 15 was hugely successful. Much like BJ Levin and the employees at LinkedIn, Brett then went on to detail just how important it is to get experiences outside of the classroom and be able to set yourself apart from the rest of the pack. Though we had heard the advice before, it just goes to show how important it truly is to get involved and get experience.
