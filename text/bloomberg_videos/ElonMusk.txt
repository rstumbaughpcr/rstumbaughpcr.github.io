From the start of Bloomberg’s video, Elon Musk’s affinity for taking risks was made clear. He had taken a huge loan from the government for Tesla Motors, his electric car company, in the hopes of making affordable, popular electric cars. Opponents of the loan scoffed at Musk and the president, saying that they would never make their money back and electric cars would never be meant for consumers. <img src="img/videos/musk.jpg" style="width:250px;float:left">
In response, Musk not only returned the loan as well as interest but also gave the government a surplus, meaning the taxpayers actually got money back from the success of Tesla. From an early age, Musk was taking risks. He left South Africa as a teenager with a friend and his brother and had created and sold a successful online local listing service, Zip2, for $307 million at 28 years old. In terms of Tesla, Musk was faced with the difficult decision: either let Tesla die or invest all of his reserve capital into the company. He chose the latter, and it certainly paid off. Like a true innovator, Musk has never been averse to taking risks. 

Throughout this course, we have talked about taking risk and being open to smart risks. To hear real stories about it from the man who made these risks, however, is something completely different. Musk gave quite literally everything he had for the success of his companies. At a point in his life, he was not only going through a divorce and a court battle with Fisker Automotive but also the potential failure of his rocket company SpaceX. Like a professional and an innovator, Musk had to tough it all out while coming up with a new plan for SpaceX in order to ensure its success. The story of Elon Musk taught me the real difference between talking about risks and taking them; it requires a huge amount of courage to be willing to put it all on the line for your company. That’s what makes Musk an innovator, however. His passion and conviction combined with his openness towards risk has made him incredibly successful and entrepreneurial.
