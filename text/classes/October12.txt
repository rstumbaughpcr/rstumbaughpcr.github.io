The main goal of this class has been to get inside the mind of an innovator or an innovative company and try and figure out how it works. A great way of figuring out how innovators think and how innovative companies function is to look not only at companies which excel at innovation but also to take a look at companies that were at the top of the market but quickly flopped, as they were not able to keep up with the changing marketplace. This tendency for a successful company to quickly fall off is called The Incumbent’s Curse, as outlined in Gerard Tellis’ Book Unrelenting Innovation. Innovative companies have three distinct traits; companies which fail to innovate, unsurprisingly, lack these three traits.

For a company to be innovative, they must be willing to cannibalize their current products. This means that a company must be willing to put out new products that will risk the success of their current cash cows. Businesses overvalue their current products and are averse to doing anything that may risk the revenue generated by that product. As an example, Sony was not willing to cannibalize the Walkman while Apple put out the iPod, a digital music player. As a result, Sony eventually flopped and Apple took over as market leader. In the words of Steve Jobs, “If you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone else will.” 

Going off of the cannibalization of current products, companies must have an environment which embraces risk. Tellis notes that companies typically overestimate risk and overvalue their current products, while simultaneously underestimating opportunities as they present themselves. This is not to say companies should go and invest in random risky ventures; however, calculated and informed risk is an essential part of being innovative. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, put it perfectly when he said, “The biggest risk is not taking any risk.”

Lastly, an innovative company must focus on the future instead of the present. Too many businesses are too worried about what is going on right now and what happened yesterday that they are not prepared when the business landscape changes drastically. Blockbuster, for example, could not see that the movie rental business was moving from in-store to online and streaming services. Though they had multiple chances to buy Netflix, they decided that the online streaming services was going nowhere; as a result, Blockbuster went bankrupt and now Netflix dominates the movie rental market. 

Tellis, however, does offer ways to overcome the Incumbent’s Curse. Businesses should create incentives for enterprise. Rather than give out rewards or extra bonuses for loyalty and staying at the company for a long time, they should reward success. Incentives for success are more effective in generating innovative ideas than incentives for loyalty. Companies should also foster internal markets; competition within departments of the company promotes innovation and creates an environment which encourages new ideas. Lastly, they should appoint innovation “champions” as models for employees to try and emulate. At Apple, there is Steve Jobs. Amazon, Jeff Bezos, Nike, Phil Knight. The culture of a company is just as important as its actual business practices.

While author Gerard Tellis may see these three traits as separate ideas, personally I think it boils down to one main concept: be adaptive. The business landscape is anything but static; it is constantly changing, as are the needs and desires of consumers. For an incumbent to remain successful, they must adapt to the ever-changing marketplace. Incumbents that are unable to adapt are unable to survive and continue to dominate the market. I do not think that it should be called The Incumbent’s Curse but rather The Incumbent’s Affliction. “Curse” implies that it is something random, inexplicable, and incurable. “Affliction,” however, hints at something understood and curable. The cure to The Incumbent’s Curse is to be adaptable to a changing marketplace, which is of course easier said than done.

After college, I plan on going into the field of software development. Programming and technology are growing at an incredible rate, with tech becoming obsolete after less than a decade. My dad, who is also a computer programmer, had been working for the same company for 20 years until it was acquired by a larger corporation. 20 years as a software developer is an incredibly long of time to remain dominant in a dynamic and ever-changing industry, so I asked him how he managed to keep himself relevant. He said that he was never allowed to stop learning. He had to program servers and systems not for the present but rather for the future; he had to anticipate what the demands of the company would be five and ten years in the future when he was writing a new piece of software. He also had to keep learning new languages and skills in order to keep himself relevant. In many ways, the incumbent’s curse and its remedies apply to individuals in the workforce as well as on a larger scale.
