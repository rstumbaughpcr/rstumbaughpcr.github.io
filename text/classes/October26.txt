In this class, we learned about the concept of red and blue oceans. Red oceans are the industries that we know, that we are familiar with. Red oceans are all the existing businesses and companies; they compete in existing market space and focus on beating the competition and exploiting existing demand. Businesses in red oceans need to make a decision between differentiating themselves from the other companies in their red ocean and providing a service or product at a low cost. Red ocean companies are simply not innovative as they cater to existing markets and play on previous products and demands.

Blue oceans, on the other hand, are the polar opposite. They don’t have to worry about competition because blue oceans innovations provide a product or service to a market that has never been targeted before; they operate in uncontested markets. Because they don’t need to worry about competition, they don’t need to make the cost/value trade-off. <img src="img/classes/ocean.png" style="width:400px;float:right">
There are four main elements to a blue ocean…
* Raise - Which factors should be raised above industry standards?
* Create - What should be created that’s never been offered?
* Reduce - What should be reduced below the industry standard?
* Eliminate - What standards or components should be eliminated?
The Four New Value Curve is not about making an existing industry better by simply adding to it; instead, blue oceans improve upon the red oceans by not only adding but also figuring out what is extraneous or overvalued and what standards should be raised. As a case study, we discussed how Cirque du Soleil is a blue ocean and why it is outperforming the red oceans, such as the Ringling Bros. Circus. 

Cirque took away all animals in their shows and focus more on acrobatics and skill rather than over-the-top visual gags. Cirque combines theater with the circus, creating a market for adults and kids alike. Cirque has much lower operating costs compared to the traditional circuses and brings in a business side to the circus.

When the Nintendo Wii came out, I remember thinking how different it was from the PlayStation 2 that I had played religiously as a child. Instead of creating another gaming console with a button-riddled joystick controller, they created the Nintendo Wii. The Wii was a revolution in console gaming - in fact, Revolution was the Wii’s internal codename during its creation. In most existing gaming consoles, users remained stationary in their chairs; with the Wii, however, players used a wand-like controller stick with 3-D motion sensors that required the user to move around while playing the game. Users were able to get up and move around the room to become a part of the game rather than twiddling their thumbs and pressing buttons from a chair. This new interactive gaming system was unique and had no competitors; in fact, it still does not have many popular rivals in the gaming world. Microsoft tried to respond with Kinect, a camera set on top of the TV that tracked users’ movements and gestures. The Kinect, however, was never as popular as the Wii and its successor, the Wii U. Instead of making another typical gaming console, Nintendo chose to create a blue ocean in the gaming world, creating a new market of interactive gaming.

With each framework and strategy I learn in this class, I become more familiar with what it takes to innovate and how a company can truly differentiate itself from the competition. It’s not about adding more and more to the product and giving the customer every feature and service available. Innovation is about realizing what is important to the consumer and what can be cut back. Innovations focus on giving the user what they want, nothing more and nothing less. With each new concept learned, I come one step closer to being an innovator myself and getting inside the mind of a creative thinker.
