Venture capitalist Jonathan Aberman came to UMD today to talk to us about entrepreneurship and personal success. Right off the bat, Aberman came of as very relaxed and casual; he was wearing a casual button-down with the sleeves rolled up, looking much more relaxed than Ed Snider (who had been wearing a full suit). Aberman started off with a rather strange topic: jujitsu. The idea of jujitsu is to use your opponent’s force against them. Aberman proposed this could be applied not only in martial arts but in life as well. When he met people who had unfounded prejudices and biases, the entrepreneur would use “‘jujitsu” to make them see just how close-minded they are. Another interesting topic discussed by Aberman is that of plagiarism. He said that in order to be successful, you should look at who is successful and steal from them: “schmooze and plagiarize.” His last two points were about taking risk versus making informed decision - entrepreneurship is not about taking risks but rather making informed decisions - and how no matter how bad things seem, they can always get worse. 

To be quite honest, I didn’t find much of what Aberman was saying to be very insightful. He definitely had good advice, but I feel it was mostly either common sense or things we had already learned in readings or videos. However, it is always a cool opportunity to hear from a new perspective and point of view in the business world.
