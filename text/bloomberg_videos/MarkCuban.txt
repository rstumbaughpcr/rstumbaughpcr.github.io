From a young age, Mark Cuban was an entrepreneur. Cuban made his fortune from broadcast.com, which was an Internet-based service that broadcasted pretty much any event you could think of: sports games, concerts, even Victoria’s Secret events. He’s now branched out to NBA ownership and is the star of a popular TV show, “Shark Tank”. He started off selling newspapers, garbage bags, and stamps. At 16, his neighbor trusted him with $5000 to go to New York and buy stamps, which just goes to show the kind of reputation as an entrepreneur he had at such a young age. His first real business, a bar called “Motley’s”, apparently used the same business model Cuban would use for his next large business ventures. Needless to say, being an entrepreneur had been in his blood since day one.

Mark Cuban is the embodiment of the entrepreneurial mindset; he had always been buying and selling since day one. The most interesting aspect, to me, was the type of reputation he had had with his neighbors at just 16 years old. Throughout his career, Cuban never stopped coming up with new business ventures. From broadcast.com to Motley’s to the a basketball team, he was the driving force behind many, many businesses and startups. Cuban’s dedication and ruthlessness makes him the quintessential businessman.  Cuban seemed to be the perfect entrepreneur and, in his own words, the “luckiest man in the world.” What I admire about Cuban is how he’s never afraid to put it all on the line and come up with a new business just to see how it will work out. “Over the past 20 years I’ve always been about, what’s new what’s next and how am i getting there first.” - Mark Cuban.
