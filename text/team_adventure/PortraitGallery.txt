The National Portrait Gallery, as the name suggests, is a huge collection of portraits and sculptures from a huge range of time periods. The first exhibit we visited when we walked in is called “Eye Pop” and consisted of portraits of modern icons in entertainment and sports, such as Eminem and Serena Williams. The exhibit immediately stood out to us because the walls were painted a vibrant lime green instead of the drab white and beige like the rest of the museum. While walking through the gallery, one sculpture in particular stood out to me.A foot-tall bronze sculpture painted by Mahonri Young in 1931, “The Knockdown” is an incredible sculpture depicting two boxers in the middle of a bout. Incredible detail was put into the design of the two men; each muscle and tendon can be distinguished as one of the fighters winds up to deliver the final blow. As soon as I saw the statue, I had a vivid image of a 1930’s boxing match, with cameras flashing, limbs flailing, and crowds cheering. “The Knockdown” is an incredibly interesting and intricate piece of art. My group and I then proceeded to head upstairs to find the sculpture we were supposed to see while at the gallery: “Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations’ Millennium General Assembly”. As I tried to decipher the cryptic title, I wondered what the sculpture might look like. At first glance, it looked like a pile of trash. Duct tape held together cardboard in the shape of what appeared to be an altar. The description of the sculpture revealed the story behind the artwork: janitor and artist James Hampton spent 14 years collecting cardboard, light bulbs, aluminum foil, and other miscellaneous materials to make this sculpture. While I didn’t find the piece of art very visually appealing or impressive, the dedication and time commitment of the artist must be respected.
