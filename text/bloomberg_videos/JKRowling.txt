In a time period where children just weren’t reading, JK Rowling was able to create the most successful book and movie franchise from nothing. Rowling is a true rags-to-riches story; she comes from a very poor neighborhood where everyone wore the same clothes and had the same wallpaper in their homes simply because that’s all that was available. While on a stalled train, Rowling had the idea of a boy who is a wizard, but doesn’t know he is a wizard, attending a school for wizards. Without a pen or paper, Rowling had to scribble down her ideas frantically on a napkin as she dreamt up the staff of Hogwarts. After completing the first few chapters and being rejected from multiple publishing agencies, Rowling was able to find a publisher in the US and UK who would be willing to publish her first book, <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</i>; of course, the rest is history. 

What surprise me the most was the large backlash from religious groups and opponents of the series. Many felt that the books glorified witchcraft and the occult; even Pope Benedict the XVI had his reservations about the series. The American Library Association deemed the books the most challenged text in the United States. However, the backlash did not affect sales at all. In interviews, Rowling stayed strong and firm, defending her children’s books. From the start of the series, Rowling had faced a lot of adversity; from not finding a publisher to vocal opponents of the series, she had faced many different challenges throughout her life. Instead of faltering and giving up, the author stayed strong and passionate and was determined to continue chasing her dreams. She is now incredibly philanthropic and donates to various charities. JK Rowling is truly an inspiration.
