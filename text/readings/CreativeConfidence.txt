From all of the books I’ve read and lectures I’ve attended and videos I’ve watched and companies I’ve visited throughout this class, one particular message keeps popping up everywhere: make yourself stand out. Whether it be in the job market or simply within a company, it is necessary to separate myself from the rest through creativity and unique experiences. The biggest challenge, however, is building up the courage to think uniquely and differently. In <i>Creative Confidence</i>, David and Tom Kelley outline many ways to think creatively and case studies of design thinking and creativity.

Before starting this entry, I searched the book for good warm-up exercises to get my mind in the creative mood and found the perfect thing: The Thirty Circles Challenge. Found in Chapter 7, the Thirty Circles Challenge involves trying to fill 30 circles on a page with as many things as possible in three minutes. Though seemingly simple, the challenge ended up being a lot harder than expected. I only managed to fill 17 out of the 30 circles in the time allotted; though I had initially thought that the only problem would be the time constraint, I found myself quickly running out of ideas, resorting to things that were directly in front of me (logos and icons found on my MacBook desktop) and just different variations of smiley faces. Being creative is certainly no easy task, and, like all other skills, requires time and practice to get better at. 

In Chapter 8, the authors outline many ways to improve your creative confidence. All throughout the class, I have been looking inward and trying to figure out my own strengths and weaknesses, and I am not ashamed to admit that creativity is not my strong suit. Interestingly enough, I can remember just how creative I used to be as a young child in elementary and middle school. I was always reading books, writing stories, and thinking outside the box. It feels like my creative abilities have gone downhill since then, and I am tending to think more conventional ideas rather than different and weird thoughts. After years of having societal norms and customs impressed upon me, I feel like it’s changed my tendencies to thinking only that which is deemed “normal.” 
I’ve been trying to approach problems from a different perspective and to think critically about messages and such rather than accepting them on surface value. I’ve noticed an interesting overlap between <i>Creative Confidence</i> and my Media Literacy course which I’m taking right now. Media Lit is all about reprogramming the code in your brain that determines how we perceive messages in the media; by default, we simply let our automatic filtering process do the work and accept messages on face value without thinking critically. In a sense, this is what I’ve been doing with regard to thinking creatively. I have made a point to actively try and think more creatively and outside the box when approaching problems in general by purposefully changing my habits of thinking about problems and perceiving messages.
