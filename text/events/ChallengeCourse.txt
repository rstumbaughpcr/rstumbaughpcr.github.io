Going into the team adventure exercise, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I wasn’t necessarily looking forward to it; it just seemed like a big waste of time to me. While I was there, however, my opinion changed completely. I thought it was a great activity and way to get everyone to interact and work collectively as a team. After some icebreaker activities, we started off with an interesting game where we could not open our eyes at all for the duration. We were all given one or two shapes and we were told the color of our shapes. There were four different colors for each shape and five different shapes in total, and we had to figure out which three shapes the facilitator didn’t give out. We had to use our hands to feel the shape and describe the shape to everyone else in order to find a match. The shapes weren’t ordinary triangles, squares, or circles; instead, they were houses, barns, mustaches, and hearts that were surprisingly hard to describe. As soon as we heard the word “Go!”, we all started screaming the color and shape of the objects we were holding in hopes of finding someone with a similar shape. Describing the shape and remembering the colors we had “seen” and hadn’t “seen” was incredibly frustration, and tempers rose quickly. Eventually, we did figure it out after lots of disorganization and mayhem. The facilitators were less than impressed with how we handled the task. Afterwards, we resolved to make a plan and strategize before we jump right into things for future tasks.

The next few challenges they gave us were fairly interesting as well -- we had to fit our team of about a dozen onto a tarp and get everyone to stand on the other side of the tarp without stepping on the surrounding concrete. After that, we had to walk across a tightrope with only a few ropes to keep us stable and walk our entire team across. The catch, however, was that the whole team must be connected by either a rope or by touching another member of the team. Frustration set in pretty early on in this task too, and people were trying to rush across without thinking of a strategy or keeping the team linked together. At this point, the facilitators were pretty clearly frustrated with us and did not seem to be having a good time. It took a fairly long time to get everyone across, but eventually we did it. Like after each one of the challenges we did, we all sat down with the facilitators to discuss how we feel it went. We pretty quickly realized that our communication skills were lacking towards the beginning but got better towards the end. In both the tarp challenge and the tightrope, we failed to set up a game plan and strategize before jumping into the activity and just started walking across as soon as we heard “Go!” Though we said we were going to come up with a strategy beforehand, we never really had a good game plan before starting the challenge.

As a result of this exercise, I took a look at how I handle projects and problems in general, whether it be in school or doing independent projects or anything at all. I tend to jump right into things rather than sit back and plan, no matter how much I tell myself I will sit back and plan things out beforehand. Saying is different from doing, and I need to do these things for the sake of creating a thoughtfully prepared project. In programming especially, determining the architecture and necessary libraries / repositories I can utilize in a project is necessary before jumping right into code. After this exercise, I have made it a  point to jot things down in a notebook I bought specifically for planning programming assignments out and have used it for every comp sci lab and project I’ve been assigned.
