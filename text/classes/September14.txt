In order to think like an innovator, it only makes sense that one should observe innovators and think about what skills they have in common. In this lecture, that is exactly what we did: we learned about innovators from different industries and time periods and applied the Innovator’s DNA to them. We discussed people and entrepreneurs from a broad range of industries. From Ted Turner to Jack Dorsey to Jeff Bezos, all of the people we discussed were relatively strong in five specific skills. These skills, which have been dubbed the Innovator’s DNA, revolve around broadening one’s horizons and being alert, attentive, and open to new ideas.

From this class, I learned that the five skills of discovery, questioning, association, observation, and networking are not requirements or a blueprint to innovation but rather an observation of what all innovators have in common. As a result, I have been actively trying to improve my own application of these skills and get my mind the habit of thinking deeply and critically about things and not just taking them on face value. At this point in the course, I began to notice a strange and unexpected overlap between this class and my Media Literacy course. Media Literacy is about being able to understand the context, framing, and agenda of a message and get past the surface level in order to get the message’s true value. Whether the message be a commercial or billboard or online advertisement, marketers and advertisers rely on the fact that viewers will often be in a state of “automaticity”, which is when our minds go on “autopilot” and filter messages and perceive them without thinking critically.

In many ways, I was in a state of automaticity when trying to solve problems. I would view the problem at face value and if the answer didn’t come to me instantaneously, I wasn’t exactly sure where to go from there. In addition, I wasn’t actively making connections and associating unlike things like an innovator would. Realizing my weaknesses and just how much I have to learn and improve in order to be an innovator inspired me and got me excited for the rest of the course and for opportunities to apply my knowledge.
