The last stop on our journey was at Goldman Sachs, where we talked to Doug Kletter, another Maryland graduate. At Goldman, Doug works in rates sales where he trades pretty much anything that has to do with interest rates. He went on to discuss the high-stress environment of the trading floor at Goldman and how in a few mere seconds, he managed to lose $50,000 for the company. He said, however, that mistakes happen. The biggest thing that people do wrong at GS is either they don’t learn from their mistakes or they try to cover them up. Either one of these things, he says, will surely get you fired. He once saw his Vice President make an error that was costing the company $750,000 for every hundredth of a percentage point the interest rates changed just by placing the decimal point in the wrong spot. Though the error was massive and could have been catastrophic, the VP simply raised his hand for help and owned up to his mistakes. Doug emphasized that at Goldman, making mistakes is all part of the job; it is how you handle the mistakes that determines whether or not you get to stick around. 

Being an investment bank, you would think that they are looking for Finance or Business majors. According to Doug, however, you’re much less likely to get hired being a business major, especially from a state school like Maryland. He said that now more than ever they are looking for Computer Science and Engineering majors. Of course, I was delighted to hear this, unlike the majority of the business majors in the room. The main concept I took away from this visit was that in life, it is okay to make a mistake and fail. It’s not okay, however, to keep making the same mistake over and over.
